# lunch
Internal tool to select a place to eat.

Lunch currently only supports the Podium SoCo offices.
To create a different location, create a new .lunch file with
the same format, detailing nearby restaurants. Then, change the file
that the script opens to this data file.

# setup
```
git clone https://github.com/jack-davidson/lunch
cd lunch
```

## usage
Change directory to the repository for lunch.
```
cd /directory/of/lunch/repository
```
Then, run the lunch script.
```
./lunch
```
